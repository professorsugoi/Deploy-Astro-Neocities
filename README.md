# üê±‚ÄçüöÄ Astro + Neocities
*This is a Fork of [Deploy-To-Neocities](https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities) (courtesy of [bcomnes](https://github.com/bcomnes)) ‚ô• If you are not using an SSG, their method may be what you're looking for.*

## Quickstart

Import the `.github/workflows` folder from this repo into your astro project and edit the `neocities.yaml` file.
> Feel free to use another static site generator of your choosing is Astro isn't your speed.  
> (*NOTE: Your build path may be named differently in other SSGs*).

## Usage

```neocities.yaml
name: Deploy to Neocities

# only run on changes to master
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # change to your branch name if different

concurrency: # prevent concurrent deploys doing strange things
  group: deploy-to-neocities
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: /lts*

      - name: Install dependencies and build site
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

      # When the dist folder is ready, deploy it to neocities
      - name: Deploy to Neocities
        uses: bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.NEOCITIES_API_TOKEN }}
          cleanup: true # change to false to prevent orphan files from being removed on neocities
          dist_dir: dist

      #- name: Push changes to GitHub
      #  run: |
      #    git config user.email "YOUR_EMAIL_HERE"
      #    git config user.name "YOUR_USERNAME_HERE"
      #    git add .
      #    git commit --allow-empty -m "actions: deploy + commit"
      #    git push

      ## uncomment this block if you want to push commits to neocities *and* github
      ## see the README "optional" step for more information
```

Generate your Neocities API token at:

```
https://neocities.org/settings/{{your-sitename}}#api_key
```

Then go to your Github Repository Settings and enter your key as a new secret:

```
Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
```

- Name: NEOCITIES_AP_TOKEN
- Secret: `ENTER YOUR API KEY HERE`


## Optional

Enable permissions for Github Actions to write to your repo _in addition_ to deploying to Neocities.

```
Settings > Actions > General
```

- Scroll down to the `Workflow permissions` and tick the box `Read and Write Permissions`.


## Inputs

`api_token`: (REQUIRED): The API token for your Neocities website to deploy to.

`dist_dir`: The directory deployed to Neocities, and Astro's build directory. Do not change this unless you also change Astro's build path.  
Default: `dist`

`cleanup`: If true, `deploy-to-neocities` will delete files on Neocities not found in `dist` or `public`.  
Default: `false`

`protected_files`: An optional glob string used to mark files as protected. Protected files are never cleaned up. Test this option out with cleanup set to false before relying on it. Protected files can still be updated.

## ( `Œµ¬¥ ) Note!

I made this repo to learn more about Astro and Github Actions, and also for my own convenience.  
While I'm still a novice at coding, maybe others can find it useful too.
